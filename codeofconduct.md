# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct was adapted from the
[Mozilla code of conduct](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)

These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:

- Background
- Family status
- Gender
- Gender identity or expression
- Marital status
- Sex
- Sexual orientation
- Native language
- Age
- Ability
- Race and/or ethnicity
- National origin
- Socioeconomic status
- Religion
- Geographic location
- Any other dimension of diversity


Our main aim is not only to _teach individuals how to code_ but to **build a supportive and empowering community** for and by women interested in pursuing a career in tech.

Hence all the instructors, attendees, helpers, ambassadors, and invited speakers have to adhere to this code of conduct.

Behaviours violating this code of conduct will not be tolerated. If you witness any behaviour violating this CoC please inform your lead instructors: Tania Allard and Darren Vong.

## Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected of all instructors
and attendees of CodeFirst girls courses:

## Be Respectful
Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be kind in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.


## Be Direct but Professional
We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.

## Be Inclusive
Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.

Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:

- Remote (on video or phone)
- Not native language speakers
- Coming from a different culture
- Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”
- Living in a different time zone
- Facing other challenges to participate

Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.
