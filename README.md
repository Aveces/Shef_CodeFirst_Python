# Shef_CodeFirst_Python
Course materials for the Advanced Python course in Sheffield ðŸ¤–

I created a custom stylesheet that overrides some of the default styles from the 'reveal.js' themes. This should work with both the 'white' and the 'black' themes. Feel free to use the one you like the most.

You can check the demo one here:

To start creating your own slides just fork the repository, go to the `gh-pages` branch and copy the demo `slide.html` file, rename it with the session number (e.g session1) and get working. Once you have completed your slides make a pull request and assign any other of your fellow instructors as a reviewer. They will then merge your PR.
